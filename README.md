Rust-VPK
========

A tool to list, and unpack VPKv1 and v2 files and to create VPKv1 files. (WIP)

Similar to [another tool](https://github.com/panzi/unvpk) I wrote, but this time
in Rust instead of C++ (for the fun of it!).

TODO
----

* [x] list
* [x] check
* [x] unpack
* [ ] pack (and maybe update?)
* [ ] read-only fuse filesystem?
* [ ] better help message
* [ ] refactor into lib + cli program?
* [ ] choose license (probably GPLv3 or LGPLv3)
